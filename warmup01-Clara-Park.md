Cooking Recipe
==============

Apple Pancake Recipe
--------------------

### Ingredients

    * 2 eggs, well beaten
    * 1 1/2 cups of milk or yogurt (I used milk and am only assuming that the yogurt will work as well)
    * 2 cups all-purpose flour
    * 1 teaspoon baking powder
    * 1/2 teaspoon salt
    * 1/4 cup sugar
    * 3 medium apples, peeled and coarsely grated (I used yellow delicious, but will use a more tart variety next time)
    * Extra flavorings (see recipe notes)
    * Vegetable oil, for frying
    * Confectioner’s sugar, for dusting\

### Special Tools

    * A large bowl
    * Smaller bowls
    * Measured cup
    * Measured spoon\

### Steps

    1. Mix the eggs with the milk or yogurt in a large bowl.

    2. In a smaller bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar together.

    3. Combine the wet and the dry ingredients and stir in the apples and whatever other flavorings you see fit.

    4. Heat a thin layer of oil in a skillet over low to medium heat. Drop large spoonful of batter into the pan and flatten it out a little (otherwise, you might have trouble getting them to cook in the center) and cook until golden brown underneath. Flip the pancakes and cook them for an additional two or three minutes.

    5. Either dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately, or keep on a tray in a warmed oven until you are ready to serve them.\

-   **Is there a special season of the year for it?**

Apple pancake is not a seasonal food, but the apple ingredient reminds of fall.

-   **Are there variations of the recipe? Using other ingredients?**

Apple pancake is an easy-to-make breakfast menu. It can be made of other ingredients other then apple like other kinds of berries. Also with different flavors of syrup will taste even richer.

**Comments and Reflections**
============================

-   **What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?**

> It was hard to correctly insert an image link to insert the image. The correst link must be written in a correct format and to type the correct format took some time.

-   **What was easy(-ish) even though we haven’t done it in class?**

> It was easier to write down the quadratic equation formulas than I thought. The dollar sign was an indication of equation but made errors when rendered.

-   **Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?**

> Yes, I have no programming experience so every single question took some time for me to understand and correctly type in Markdown.

-   **If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing this assignment?**

> N/A

-   **Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?**

> Yes, I had to read the assigned readings and website explanation in order rto understand the functions and type. I also asked my friend who knows how to use R Markdown about inserting the images.

-   **How much time did it take to complete this HW?**

> I took about 7 hours to completely finish the homeowrk.

-   **What was the most time consuming part?**

> The most time consuming part was to figure out how to insert the images.
